# Game-UI-Multi-Platform

### Current State
Draws the main intro panel with login and exit working as intended. When in the login panel you can tab between the inputs and press enter to fire them off. Text is centered depending on boolean set when instantiated. Recieves the account name and password in switch statement of the method ChangeWindow() in IntroWindow class file.

Currently draws a scroll bar that I'm working on to display movement between the buttons. This will be decided on the panel's height compared to the amount of the inner window of the panel being displayed. then will need to work on sending drag and drop inputs or button clicks at the top and bottom of the scrollbar
